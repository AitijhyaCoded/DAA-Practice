# ✨ DAA-Practice ✨

Welcome to **DAA-Practice**, a collection of *easy-to-understand*, *beginner-friendly* implementations of all major **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** topics — tailored specially for 4th-semester students (and anyone who wants to finally *understand* what the algorithm is doing 😅).

Unlike most explanations floating around the internet, this repo keeps things **super simple**, **clean**, and **concept-first**. Because who said DAA has to be scary?

|------------------------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force Algorithms             | ✔️          |
| Divide and Conquer                 | ✔️          |
| Greedy Algorithms                  | ✔️          |
| Dynamic Programming                | ✔️          |
| Backtracking                       | ✔️          |
| Branch and Bound                   | ✔️          |
